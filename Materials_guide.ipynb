    "Importantly, the size of the device needs to be divisible by the voxel size. Additionally, the voxel size needs to be suffiently larger than the resolution of the Yee-grid in the simulation. For example, if the resolution of the Yee-grid is also 200nm, then this simulation will not produce accurate results. As a rule of thumb, the resolution of the Yee-grid should be at least three times smaller than the size of the voxels.\n",

    "The device has one latent parameter for every voxel. Initially, these latent parameters are uniformly random in the interval [0, 1]. The constraint mapping defines how these latent parameters are mapped to actual inverse permittivity choices.
