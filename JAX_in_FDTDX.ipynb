    "\n",
    "JAX is a high-performance numerical computing library developed by Google that brings together the familiar NumPy API with powerful features like automatic differentiation, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, and seamless GPU/TPU acceleration. Originally designed for machine learning research, JAX has become popular across scientific computing applications due to its speed and flexibility."
